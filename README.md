# FitVide - Fitness Tracking App

FitVide is a comprehensive, cross-platform fitness and wellness tracking application built with React Native and Expo. It allows users to monitor their workouts, nutrition, hydration, sleep, and overall progress, all powered by a Firebase backend.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with Firebase, including email/password and Google sign-in.
  * **Workout Logging**: Users can log their exercises, including details like workout type, region, level, sets, reps, and weight. All data is saved to Firestore.
  * **Nutrition Tracking**: Detailed meal logging for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Users can search a food database and track calories, protein, carbs, and fats.
  * **Hydration Tracker**: A simple way to log daily water intake, with a circular progress bar to visualize progress toward a daily goal.
  * **Sleep Tracking**: Users can log their sleep and wake times, and the app will calculate the duration. It also includes a feature to rate sleep quality and add notes.
  * **Progress Summary**: A dedicated screen that combines all logs (exercise, hydration, nutrition, and sleep) to give users a comprehensive view of their daily and weekly progress.
  * **Weekly Check-in**: A feature that allows users to record their body measurements and mood on a weekly basis, with charts to visualize their progress over time.
  * **User Profile**: Users can set their personal details (age, gender, height, weight), activity level, and fitness goals (cut, maintain, bulk). The app then calculates and displays their recommended daily macro targets.
